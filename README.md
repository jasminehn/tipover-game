# üèóÔ∏è Tipover Game

This is a simple Java program to simulate the game Tip-Over via the editor console. 

### Game Rules
Tipover is a solitaire puzzle game in which towers of different colors and heights are placed on a 6x6 grid with a "character" atop one of the towers.  The goal of the puzzle is to find a way to move the character from the starting location to the red crate. This is accomplished by tipping over the towers and moving the character along the newly created pathway. The program should allow a user to attempt the puzzle, and also given a puzzle and a solution, verify that the solution is correct.
